/**
 * Raw-X12 837 transmission endpoint.
 *
 * This route accepts a pre-built X12 string and an organizationId without a batch reference,
 * which means we cannot determine which payers are inside the X12 envelope. The per-payer
 * enrollment gate (T003) therefore CANNOT be evaluated here.
 *
 * To preserve T003 compliance, this endpoint is hard-gated to SANDBOX credentials only.
 * Production 837 transmission must go through `/api/claims/837p/batch/[id]/submit`, which
 * resolves the batch's payers and runs the full per-payer enrollment gate.
